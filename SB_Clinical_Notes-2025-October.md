## Clinical Notes

**Date of Assessment:** 2025-10-29

History:

Bilateral SDH withongoing seizures.HX of CKD,CML. EEG on Oct 27 : 6 electroclinical seizures arising from the rightfrontal and parietal region.

Results:

This EEG ran from 1211 until 1312. Therewas no sedation during the recording. The patient was on lacosamide andlevetiracetam.

There was no clear posterior dominant rhythm. There was continuouspolymorphic theta and delta frequencies over both hemispheres. There were approximately 1 Hzperiodic lateralized discharges present over the right hemisphere for much of the recording; spikemorphologies were at times seen maximal over F4 C4 electrodes (e.g.12:35:22). There wereincorporated faster frequencies at times seen within the periodic discharges. Intermittent photicstimulation did not appreciably alter the record. There were no seizuresrecorded.

Impression:

There were lateralized periodic discharges seen throughoutmuch of this EEG recording over the right hemisphere and maximal over the right frontocentralregion. These however did not evolve in frequency or morphology and no frank electrographicseizures were identified.

There was a continuous diffuse nonspecific disturbance ofelectrocerebral activity seen over both hemispheres throughout.

The 2helps2B score was 3.An additional point should be added for any clinical history of seizure.

**Neurology Progress Note**

Isaw Mr. Basaric this morning, with his primary nurse at the bedside. He is a an 88-year-old manadmitted under GIM, he has a right frontal SDH and brain contusions. He has a history of CMML andCAD. We were consulted for confusion and we observed 2 episodes in 15 minutes of left sided lowerface twitching. There have been no further observed seizures, and clinically he is no longer in SE.He is not currently on any sedation. He is currently being renally dosed with Keppra 500mg BID andLacosamide 50mg BID, this is a good choice given the hematological malignancy, and we thus do notsuggest phenytoin.

Suggest:  
1. Continue Keppra 500mg BID as renally dosed andLacosamide 50mg BID.  
2. Repeat routine EEG on Friday  
3. Based on clinical progressionand electrographic evolution, we can decide how to taper his ASMs. Likely we can do a cross-taper,by decreasing the Keppra and maintaining on Lacosamide.

(October 26) MRI brain  
- Cytoxic edema involving the right frontal lobe subjacent to the right frontal subduralhematoma. Given its wedge-shaped configuration this is favored to represent ischemia. This may haveresulted from disturbed microcirculation because of the  
adjacent hemorrhage, possibly incombination with watershed ischemia, or less likely embolic ischemia. Reactive cortical cytotoxicchange to the hemorrhage, post-contusional restriction diffusion, and post seizure changes areother additional  
considerations, but less favored. A cerebritis is considered unlikely giventhe absence of features of empyema, though it cannot be entirely excluded  
- No significantinterval change in the multicompartment hemorrhages, allowing for technical differences betweenstudies. Ventricular size remains stable.

(October 27) EEG  
This was an abnormalEEG.  
1. 6 self-limited electroclinical seizures were seen arising from the right frontalregion, accompanied by chewing movements.  
2. Interictal discharges were seen arising fromboth frontal lobes  
3. Focal slowing was seen in the same regions

**Allergies:**NKDA

**Social History:** At home with wife who was recently admittedto hospital last week with stroke-like symptoms (but now home). Walker for ambulation which is newin the past year. Independent in ADLs and IADLs - was changing tires on his car and driving thispast week. Retired mechanical engineer. Non-smoker, no drugs, no ETOH. Serbianspeaking

**HPI:**  
This is an 88-year-old male with a past medicalhistory significant for CAD, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and CMML ontransfusions, who presented to Sunnybrook on October 24 with a 48-hour history of confusion andaphasia, which progressed to complete mutism. He was found to have bilateral subdural hematomas,with no role for surgical intervention as per Neurosurgery. He was also noted to have abnormalfacial movements, which were later confirmed to be seizures (EEG). Unfortunately, the frequency ofthese seizures has increased, occurring approximately every 7 minutes since October 24; with noreturn to baseline. There has been no improvement despite initiation of Keppra (loaded at 60 mg/kgon October Oct 24; then continued at 500 mg BID) and 2 mg of IV Ativan on October 28(today).

The patient's daughter at the bedside reported that the last time he was able torespond with nodding was around 10 a.m. today. However, it is important to note that he has notreturned to his baseline since his admission (Independent at baseline).

His daughterpresent at bedside reported that he actually had 2 falls in the past year (3 months ago and 6months ago, unclear if he hit his head) - ask because of his bilateral subdurals.  
  
Iimmediately paged rapid response team who further loaded patient with phenytoin and accepted as atransfer to the ICU. He was overall given 500 mg of Keppra today, 6 mg of Ativan and loaded withphenytoin.

  
**Exam:**  
When we were paged today, and I came to assess the patient in his room, his GCS was 7 (E1, V1, M5). He was unresponsive, with his eye sclosed, and he could not be awakened. He was protecting his airways; his BP was 97/39, RR12, O2 sat96% on RA, HR 67. He was withdrawing all four limbs in response to pain. His eyes were in primary gaze with slight left sided deviation, and bilateral hippus; however, both pupils were equal and reactive to light. Deep tendon reflexes were equal and symmetrical at 2+, and plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally.  
I have noticed 2 episodes in 15 minutes of left sided lower face twitching that lasted 30-40 seconds.  
  
**Investigations:**  
Albumin 29, calcium 1.96, phosphate 1.29  
Hemoglobin 16.9, white blood cell count 4.8,platelet count 41  
Creatinine 151, glucose 6.8, INR 1.56  
  
**Imaging:**  
(October 28) CT head  
- Slight increase in thickness of the acute on chronic left cerebral convexity hematoma. No significant increase in mass effect. No local new hyperdensity to suggest significant interval subdural hemorrhage.  
- Interval development of inferior left frontal hypodensity with new small volume local hyperdense components, in keeping with an evolving contusion with increased edema and limited new hemorrhagic changes.  
- No other adverse interval change demonstrated.

(October 26) MRI brain  
- Cytoxic edema involving the right frontal lobe subjacent to the right frontal subdural hematoma. Given its wedge-shaped configuration this is favored to represent ischemia. This may have resulted from disturbed microcirculation because of the  
adjacent hemorrhage, possibly in combination with watershed ischemia, or less likely embolic ischemia. Reactive cortical cytotoxic change to the hemorrhage, post-contusional restriction diffusion, and post seizure changes are other additional  
considerations, but less favored. A cerebritis is considered unlikely given the absence of features of empyema, though it cannot be entirely excluded  
- No significanti nterval change in the multicompartment hemorrhages, allowing for technical differences between studies. Ventricular size remains stable.

(October 27) EEG  
This was an abnormalEEG.  
1. 6 self-limited electroclinical seizures were seen arising from the right frontalregion, accompanied by chewing movements.  
2. Interictal discharges were seen arising fromboth frontal lobes  
3. Focal slowing was seen in the same regions  
4. The background wasslightly slow.  

**Impression and plan:**  
Patient's current presentation os most Ilkley consistent with status epilepticus with his seizures related to his bilateral subdural hematomas. Rapid team assessed the patient and he ws further transferred to theICU. He was loaded with phenytoin following 6 mg of ativan and 500 mg of IV Keppra. He had a repeat CT which revealed slight increase in thickness of the acute on chronic left cerebralconvexity hematoma and interval development of inferior left frontal hypodensity with new small volume local hyperdense components, in keeping with an evolving contusion with increased edema and limited new hemorrhagic changes. Neurosurgery signed off - no role for intervention. At this time we do recommend to continue this patient on Lacosamide 50 mg BID and Keppra 750 mg bid (or a kidney adjusted dose) with further uptitration if this dose is ineffective for the management of his seizures.  
We will follow.

**Goalsof care**  
_1220 - 1320_  
  
I was able to meet with Dobrosav'sdaughter, Lydia, at bedside and provide an update regarding his clinical condition including the deterioration of his conscious level. Lydia and Alex(son) have a shared POA regarding their father. She mentioned that before this admission, in his prior hospital visits, her father was clear about not wanting any artificial support that would 'keep him hanging in misery'. I noted that his Princess Margaret Hospital clinic visit also mentions DNR/DNI.  
While Lydia was understandably distraught, we(myself, her and Alex via phone call) were able to have a conversation including Dobrosav's expressed wishes and the family's will to not make it uncomfortable or painful for him more than needs be. This includes not for CPR or intubation however okay for vasopressors and non-invasive ventilation.

**Rapid Response Team**  
  
**ID:** 88M CML with recent PCIin September 2025 and started on DAPT, now with new onset aphasia and pharyngeal symptoms. Rapid response called due to persistent left facial twitching along with drop in GCS

Dobrosav was admitted on 24th October with acute functional decline since 23rd October, noticed to be confused with difficulty swallowing and mild facial droop. While being worked up in TCU, he became aphasic for which code STROKE was called along with the ICU team. His MRI showed subdural frontal hematomas with some edema along R side. He remained alert and responsive otherwise so Rapid signed off.

He had an EGG done 27th October which showed ongoing seizures however as per report, he was at his baseline GCS of 11-12/15 E4M6V1-2 till 10:00am this morning. He was noticed to have abnormal movements of jaw, lip smacking and staring episodes for which IVLorazepam was given along with loading of Levetiracetam. He has not regained consciousness since then with GCS 5-6/15 and has had repeated episodes requiring further BZD pushes, last at 12:15 pm.

Given possiblesub-clinical seizures with status epilepticus, we will admit to L2 ICU

**Date of Assessment:** 2025-10-28 11:44

Reassessed at bedside -- Neurology noted ongoing seizure activity (facial and lip twitching, upper limb movements), and one lasting 45s was observed despite 1g Keppra bid and now 2mg Lorazepam IV -- his LOC is greatly reduced, GCS5 but he is currently protecting his airway. Seizures confirmed on EEG yesterday. Concern is low BPand low GCS, potential with any more anticonvulsant activity that he will not protect his airway. Issues remain about the balance between cerebral bleeding and restenosis of his fresh LCx stentfrom a month ago (DAPT held for 3 days so far). Rapid called -- will discuss with Critical Care.

## Clinical Notes

### Neurology progress note

We were called about this patient by internal medicine team.They reported the patient continues to have episodes of abnormal movements of his jaw, lipsmacking,staring episodes, abnormal contractions of periorbital muscles. Apparently he has never returned to his baseline since Saturday. He continues to have these episodes. He is currently on Keppra500 twice daily. He had similar episodes before but never that frequent. He was loaded with Keppra on Friday. With no positive effects.  
  
We do think these episodes are most likely related to his bilateral subdural hematomas. There is no role for intervention from neurosurgical standpoint (as per neurosurgery team). They signed off.  
  
As per conversation with internal medicine Dr. Patient has never received benzodiazepines for the management of these episodes.  
He is EEG from overnight on October 28 confirmed that he has electroclinical seizures arising from the right frontal region, accompanied by chewing movements. With interictal discharges arising from both frontal lobes.  
  
When I was on the call with internal medicine Dr. Patient was having another episode.  
  
Kindly advised to give patient 2 mg of Ativan IV immediately as well as Keppra 1000 mg IV. To see whether it stops his clinical seizure episodes.  
Considering the patient has this worsening of his episodes since Saturday patient is most likely in status epilepticus.  
  
At this time his vitals are stable. He is able to protect his airways. However it is important to suppress the seizures and address possible status epilepticus.  
  
We kindly asked the internal medicine team to call rapid response team to see the patient and to identify whether patient qualifies for ICU admission, possible management with propofol, close monitoring of his neuro vitals.  
  
Will see this patient in the nearest time to assess.

## Clinical Notes

MRN 2081964

EEG 1025

Date of Recording: 2025-10-27

Date of Birth:

This is an 88 year-old male with confusion, aphasia, facial droop, seizures.Bilateral acute SDH

This is a 30 minute video EEG with the 10-20 electrodesystem.

FINDINGS

Abnormality #1: **6 electroclinical seizures** were seen arising from the right frontal and parietal region, beginning with a sudden emergence of focal alpha/beta activity evolving into slower theta activity and eventually sharp waves in the2-4Hz delta range before evolving again into theta then alpha activity and stopping after \R\1:30. These episodes were accompanied by rhythmic chewing movements. Left hemispheric activity was obscured by muscle artifact and so the extent to which ictal activity spread to the left hemisphereis not clearly demonstrated.

Abnormality #2: Frequent sharp wave discharges were seen arising from the right frotnal region, at times oraganized into PLEDS at 1-3Hz.

Abnormality #3: Sharp wave discharges were seen arising from the left frontal and at times left temporal region.

Abnormality #4: Focal slowing in the delta range was seen arising from both frontal and temporal regions.

Abnormality #5: The waking background was slightly slow, often consisting of a mixture of 8Hz alpha and 6-8Hz theta activtiy.

Sleep: Was not seen

Hyperventilation: could not bedone

Photic stimulation: induced no abnormalities

EOG: captured no abnormal eye movements

ECG: showed an at times irregular rhythm at 80-90 beats per minute

Video: as above

IMPRESSION

This was an abnormal EEG.

1. 6 self-limited electroclinical seizures were seen arising from the right frontal region, accompanied by chewing movements.

2. Interictal discharges were seen arising from both frontal lobes

3. Focal slowing was seen in the same regions

4. The background was slightly slow.

The Antimicrobial Stewardship Team reviewed this patient because they were prescribed:

Antimicrobial Dose Route Frequency Start date Enddate Indication **CEFTRIAXONE 1G/VIALINJ 1 IV Q24H 2025/10/25**

**Impression:**

88M with a complex medical history including CMML, chronic bicytopenias (Hb, Plt) requiring intermittent transfusions, CAD, T2DM and recent NSTEMI on DAPT (Sep 2025) presented to Sunnybrook on Oct 24 with fever (T38.6), left facial droop, dysphagia and confusion. CT head was notable for bilateral(L\T\gt;R) acute-on-chronic **subdural hematomas**, predominantly frontal distribution with some associated mass effect but no midline shift. The patient was consulted to neurosurgery who felt that the acute cognitive change and left-sided weakness were not readily explained by the radiologic findings, and ordered MRI brain to rule out infected subdural. Code stroke called on Oct25 as patient suddenly became non-verbal. CT showed no new intracranial hemorrhage or major territorial infarct, but re-demonstrated the chronic SDHs seen previously. As per the Stroke team, the gradual nature of the deterioration raised concern for **subdural hematomas as the underlying cause, with a possible contribution from seizures.** There was also a report of rhythmic jaw movements during which the patient was unresponsive. Stroke team started the patient on **Keppra pending EEG.** Subsequent **MRI completed on Oct 26** revealed **cytotoxic edema** involving the right frontal lobe adjacent to the right frontal subdural hematoma; favoured to represent ischemia. There is **concern that this edema may be related to microcirculatory disturbance due to the adjacent hemorrhage.** Stroke team comments that the ischemic changes in the brain are most likely secondary to local compression from the subdural hematomas.

Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h started by the RAPID team on Oct 26 in the context of initial fever. While in hospital, he has remained afebrile, vitals stable and on room air. CXR (Oct 24) showed no consolidative opacities. Blood cultures (Oct24, 25) and urine culture (Oct 24, 25) are negative to date.

In the absence of a clear infectious etiology and alternative explanation for symptoms (SDH), team to re-assess need for antibiotics with consideration for **stopping Ceftriaxone**.

# 26-Oct-2025 STR PROGRESS NOTE


## Clinical Notes

Follow -up note

October 26

We were contacted by the Internal Medicine team tofollow up on the results of the MRI for the patient seen by the Stroke team yesterday, on October25.

This is an 88-year-old male with a past medical history significant for CAD, type 2diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and CMML on transfusions, who presented toSunnybrook on October 24 with a 48-hour history of confusion and aphasia, which progressed tocomplete mutism despite being fully alert. The patient did not have any clear focal neurologicaldeficits.

A Code Stroke was activated on October 25. The patient underwent CT/CTA/CTP,which did not demonstrate any acute strokes, occlusions, or perfusion deficits, but redemonstratedchronic subdural hematomas seen previously.

As per the Stroke team, the gradual nature ofthe deterioration raised concern for subdural hematomas as the underlying cause, with a possiblecontribution from seizures. There was also a report of rhythmic jaw movements during which thepatient was unresponsive.

The MRI of the brain performed today revealed cytotoxic edemainvolving the right frontal lobe adjacent to the right frontal subdural hematoma. There is concernthat this edema may be related to microcirculatory disturbance due to the adjacent hemorrhage. Uponreview of the images, we believe these changes are not consistent with watershed or embolicischemia.

Given the patient's low hemoglobin and platelet levels, transfusion dependence,cancer-related coagulopathy, chronic subdurals, and recent GI bleed, initiation of anticoagulationor antiplatelet therapy is contraindicated from a stroke perspective at this time. We believe theischemic changes in the brain are most likely secondary to local compression from the subduralhematomas. Therefore, no further stroke-specific investigations or interventions are advised atthis time.

Of note, the patient has a history of coronary stenting; therefore, aspirin isindicated and would be beneficial for stroke prevention once it is deemed safe toresume.

However, it is essential to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus. Pleaseconsider ordering an urgent EEG. We also recommend administering a loading dose of levetiracetam(Keppra) 60 mg/kg today, followed by maintenance at 500 mg twice daily starting tomorrow, October27. If there is clinical suspicion for seizures, lorazepam 2-4 mg IV may beadministered.

Please re-involve the General Neurology team if further concernsarise.

Sincerely,  
For Dr. Reiter, Stroke Staff

**Allergies:NKDA**

**HPI:** An 88M patient with history of CAD, T2DM, CKD, HTN andCMML for which he is currently transfusion dependent presented with acute change in his mental andfunctional status. He presented to the hospital with acute onset of confusion, facial drop anddifficulty of swallowing since Thursday night. The patient's voice was also gradually softer. Forthis he was seen at the ED and investigated with CT which showed bilateral left greater than rightacute on chronic subdural hematomas predominantly frontal distribution with some associated masseffect but no midline shift. The rapid team was consulted today for sudden change in his status-suddenly become non verbal and unresponsive. During our assessment at the bedside, he wasnon-communicative but was able to raise his hands when asked.

**Examination:**

Vitals: T 38.5, BP 105/53 mmHg, HR 75, SpO2 99%, RR18  
General- Patient obeycommands but does not respond verbally  
Abdo soft, non tender, non distended.

**Investigations:**

**Imaging**

CT Perf WC+Head WOW+CTA Car+3D

Stable acute rightfrontal and acute on chronic left frontoparietal subdural hematomas with similar mild mass effect.No midline shift.  
Similar trace right frontal subarachnoid, parafalcine subdural, and smallright occipital horn intraventricular hemorrhage.  
No new large territory infarction or newhemorrhage. Ventricles and basal cisterns are normal in size and position.

CONCLUSION:  
1. No evidence of acute territorial infarct or acute vascular pathology. Perfusion abnormalitiesare likely artifactual in context of known bilateral subdural hematomas.  
2. No significantinterval change in multi-compartmental hemorrhage.  
3. Moderate stenosis of the proximal rightinternal carotid artery secondary to calcified atherosclerotic plaque burden.

CXR (Oct24)

The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, unchanged. Previous CABG surgery.Coronary stents in place.  
  
No evidence of pulmonary edema. There are few linearbandlike opacities project over the mid to lower left lung, likely representing subsegmentalatelectasis. No consolidative opacities detected to suggest underlying pneumonia/aspiration.  
  
No detectable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

I**mpression and Plan:**

Mr. Basaric is a 88 year old man with a past medical historysignificant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, type 2diabetes mellitus, CMML who presents to hospital with acute onset confusion, facial droop, anddifficulty with swallowing since Thursday night. We assessed him today for sudden onset of nonresponsiveness/non-verbal. CT showed no evidence of acute stroke.

Given records of fever,we ordered pan culture and initiated ceftriaxone 1 gm IV Q 24 hours to be started after the bloodculture.

He is maintaining his airway with saturation of 99% with atmospheric air.

It is possible that his symptom is related to his existing subdural hematoma.

Rapid team will continue to follow him

HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  
He apparently was found to be not his usual selfon October 23rd around supper time. He was somewhat confused and febrile at 38.6. He attempted toeat but was not able to swallow. The following morning he was found to have somewhat of a leftsided facial droop as per the patient's daughter and his voice was noted to be softer. He wasbrought to ED and a CT head demonstrated left greater than right acute on chronic subduralhematomas, predominantly frontal. Neurosurgery was consulted and they felt that the acute changewas not explained by the subdural hematomas. Medicine was consulted at that time for furtherworkup. As per his daughter, apparently when she came in to see him today at 5:00pm he seemed worsethan he did the night previously and went from short sentences to only saying 1 word here or there.By 11:40 tonight nursing found him to be mute and non responsive though alert, prompting a codestroke.

CODE STROKE IMAGING: ASPECTS 10, redemonstrates the bilateral subdurals with no major changes.CTA negative for acute occlusion.

IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL PLAN:  
Mr.Basaric is a 88 year old man with a past medical history significant for CAD, T2D, CKD, HTN, CMMLon transfusions who presented october 24th with a 48 hour history of confusion, and aphasia whichtonight progressed to being completely mute despite being fully alert. The patient otherwise,however, does not have any clear focal neurological deficits. CT/CTA/CTP does not demonstrate anynew strokes, acute occlusions or perfusion deficit, and redemonstrates the subdural hematomas seenpreviously in the last 24 hours.

Overall while there may be some chronicity to thesesubdural hematomas, the location of the left frontal subdural certainly could potentially lead toincreasing aphasia. I'm not entirely sure the clinical deterioration is as acute at least withrespect tonight and get the sense this may be an ongoing deterioration over the last 24 hours. Thegradual nature of the deterioration makes me suspicious of the subdurals themselves butalternatively he may also be having seizures from his subdurals. On further history with the familythey do mention seeing some rhythmic jaw movements where he was not responding intermittently. Assuch we'd recommend getting an EEG and considering simply starting empiric ASM therapy with keppra500mg BID to see if there is any improvement in his neurological status. We also understand that hehas an MRI scheduled which will help definitively ascertain if there are any further lesions notvisualized by CT.

GIM SILVER ON CALLNOTE

Paged to bedside by RN around 1141 pm stating that patient is suddenly non verbal.

I arrived at bedside, patients daughter was concerned +++ that the patient is newly nonverbal. She states his current presentation is very different than when he first arrived to thehospital. She states that at that time he was still responsive and talking, but now he has suddenlybecame non verbal.

Current vitals: BP 105/53, HR 66, SPO2 99% , RR 18,38.5C

Patient is alert, but not responding verbally to questions. He is able to follow somecommands. He is moving all 4 limbs. It is difficult to tell if he has facial drooping but itappears like he does.

Plan:

-Code Stroke

-CT head stat - no acutestroke in prelim.

-Given strict NPO til SLP assessment, will give IV tylenol 1g q6h PRN. Iam cognizant it may cause hypotension thus will give 1L NaCl bolus along with it.

-Wonderif this is a possible seizure? Although no tongue biting, incontinence, shaking waswitnessed

-Symptoms could simply be related to his existing L\T\gt;R subdural hematoma. Willpage Neurosurgery to discuss

-Continue to monitor symptoms.

**History of Presenting Illness:**  
88-year-old gentleman withhistory of CAD (CABG 2005, NSTEMI Spetmeber 2025 with POBA, and 1x DES LCx), T2DM, CKD,hypertension, CMML for which he is now transfusion dependent, this is an 88-year-old gentleman whopresents with acute change in functional status which was first noticed at some point, October23rd, 2025. He lives at home with his wife. The patient apparently did not get up for supper andwas confused at that time. The patient's daughter was called at which point she came over and wasfound to be febrile temperature 38.6 at this time. The patient reportedly attempted to eat but wasnot able to swallow, keeping food contents and medications and other despite thinking he hadswallowed them. The following morning the patient was found to have an mild left-sided facialdroop with ongoing confusion. The patient's voice was also noted to be softer.

He wasinitially seen by the ED at which time a CT head was obtained. CT head was notable for bilateralleft greater than right acute on chronic subdural hematomas predominantly frontal distribution withsome associated mass effect but no midline shift. The patient was consulted to neurosurgery whofelt that the acute cognitive change and left-sided weakness were not readily explained by theradiologic findings medicine was referred for further workup. They did arrange for MRI brain torule out infected subdural.

I saw the patient at the bedside with his son. He ispredominantly Serbian speaking but does understand English conversationally. The pain is unable tocommunicate how he is feeling different and insist that he is normal today. Patient son is atbedside is quite concerned notes that his dad is completely off. He states his voice soundsdifferent, he is not responding when spoken to sometimes, has new left-sided facial droop, and alsohas urinated himself twice. There is no noted history of whether the patient or son of recentcough, diarrhea, dysuria, abdominal pain, he denies any visual changes or diplopia. He has noheadache or neck stiffness.

**Impression/Plan:**

This is an 88-year-old male withpast medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidneydisease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CMML who presents to hospital with acute onset confusion, facialdroop, and difficulty with swallowing onset Thursday night. Patient was also noted to have a feverat home although this is not documented in ED.

  
1. Confusion/Facial droop: Acuteonsets symptoms that have perhaps been progressive over the past day and a half. He does have someleft upper extremity weakness, facial droop, and sensory extinction. There is no focal infectioussymptoms. I am worried that this could have been an ischemic event. MRI has been ordered byneurosurgery to further assess the subdural collections and rule out superinfection and this willalso hopefully show whether or not any acute ischemic events has occurred. He is afebrile here andand unfortunately is also on DAPT, so it is not currently feasible to do a lumbar puncture. Shouldhe not improve and no etiology be elucidated by the MRI, I think this patient would benefit fromlumbar puncture. I will obtain a full infectious workup including viral swabs, blood cultures, andurine cultures. We will also get a urea in case recurrent GI bleeding causing uremic encephalopathyis a possibility.  
  
2. AKI: No clear inciting risk factor. Will get abdominal ultrasoundto rule out obstructive uropathy (will get bladder scan at bedside), urine microscopy does notreveal any casts, nitrites, or leukocytes. I will see his response to fluids which will guidefurther investigations.

3. Subdural hematomas: Seen by neurosurgery-repeat CT head arestable. DAPT is on hold. Due to the fresh nature of the stents we will get a cardiology opinion onhow to proceed forward with restarting his antiplatelet therapy as.

**Neurosurgery residentattestation**  
  
In summary, this is an 88-year-old gentleman presenting with a 1day history of confusion and overall functional decline. His symptoms include a fever at home,change in his sleep and eating patterns, increased confusion, mild dysphagia, mild left drift, anda mild facial droop.  
  
Of note, he is on dual antiplatelet therapy [aspirin andclopidogrel] for NSTEMI that was stented in September 2025.  
  
The emergency departmentordered a CT which showed bilateral left greater than the right acute on chronic subdural hematomawith no midline shift. His repeat CT was stable. There is no preceding trauma.  
  
Onexamination he is GCS 14. He has a mild left drift and mild facial droop. Otherwise, hisneurological examination is overall above.

In conclusion, although the patient hasbilateral subdural hematoma with an mild acute component, likely secondary to his dual antiplatelettherapy, his current radiographic scan does not explain his change in neurological status.Additionally, he has a fever of unknown origin. The bilateral subdurals do not explain his ongoingdysphagia that the family is concerned about and his change in his normal functional baseline.  
  
To this end our plan is as follows:  
1. We will kindly ask our general internalmedicine colleagues for their assessment of the patient regarding his fever NYD and change inneurological status which may be due to delirium or infectious symptoms as the CT head is not inkeeping with his neurological changes.  
2. Given there is mild acute blood in the chronicsubdural, we recommend holding his dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 days. However, we understandthat he has had a recent stent and was started on the therapy just last month therefore werecommend a cardiology consult for their opinion on the necessity to restart the medication. If itis urgently needed, we recommend repeating a CT head in 24 hours after restarting dual antiplatelettherapy.  
3. Last, out of an abundance of caution, we will order an MRI of the brain to ruleout an empyema. This is a low likelihood but we will follow-up on the MRI when completed.Recommend PAN cultures as deemed necessary by GIM.

Thank you for involving us in the careof this patient.

**NeurosurgeryConsult Note**

**HPI:** 88M presenting with 1-day history of confusionand overall functional decline. According to his daughter, he has no prior significant or diagnosedcognitive deficits but one day before presenting to hospital, began showing signs of confusion,became lethargic, stayed in bed most of the day, and had trouble with PO intake which is notconsistent with his baseline. This was in the context of fevers at home with Tmax 38.6; he has beenafebrile in ED. Based on his report and as far as his daughter is aware there has been noassociated headache, N/V, vision changes, or new focal deficits. He was recently admitted to SBK inSept 2024 for an NSTEMI and was discharged on DAPT, and last took the medications on Oct 24 AM. CThead shows bilateral AoC SDH with L larger than R though there appears to be more of an acutecomponent on the right. No midline shift. There is also a small right frontal SAH and trace IVH inthe right occipital horn. He has been GCS14-15 since arrival to ED, for the most part AOx3, butwith clear signs of confusion intermittently.

**Assessment and Plan:**

Mr. Basaric presents with acutecognitive changes and left-sided weakness associated with radiographic findings that are in largepart chronic and do not align well with his symptoms. Based on the overall clinical picture thereis no indication for immediate neurosurgical management of the SDH's, and he will instead beadmitted for work-up of alternative explanations for his symptoms.

Plan:  
- MRI brainto r/o empyema  
- Work-up for fever NYD  
- GIM consult

**HPI**:

Seen with daughter for translation and history. 88 yomale with complex medical history including CMML, CAD, DM2 presenting with acute change infunctional status x 24 hours. Patient lives at home with his wife, who called their daughteryesterday at 7pm stating the patient did not get up for supper and appeared increasingly confused.Their daughter took his temperature and found it to be 38.6. He tried to eat but had dysphagia,keeping food contents and medications in his mouth depsite thinking he had swallowed them. He wasable to drink liquid tylenol with mild coughing. Their daughter assessed his smile and tried toassess for pronator drift last night which were both negative.

The daughter returned totheir house this morning and found that he developed a left sided facial droop and had ongoingdysphagia and confusion. There does not appear to be any aphasia, but the daughter describesdysarthria compared to baseline.

With daughter translation, the patient denies any chestpain, SOB, dysuria. Bowel movements have been normal. He states he feels well.

Of note,the patient was recently discharged on plavix in Sept 2025 following an NSTEMI. He already takesASA for his CAD, however in the past he had an episode of internal bleeding after initiatingplavix. With his CMML, the daughter states he gets nearly weekly transfusions for anemia.
