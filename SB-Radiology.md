RENAL AND PELVIC ULTRASOUND  
  
  
Comparison is made to outside ultrasound done February 13, 2025.  
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Technically difficult study due to patient factors.  
  
The right kidney is 9.5 versus 9.3 cm long. Echogenic renal cortex as seen previously, perhaps more so now. Trace perinephric fluid now. No hydronephrosis, renal stones or other abnormality.  
  
Left kidney 9.3 versus 9.1 cm long. Increased cortical echogenicity, likely slightly more so now. Trace perinephric fluid now. No hydronephrosis or renal stones. Interpolar region simple appearing cortical cyst measuring 1.3 cm, seen previously.  
  
Trabeculated urinary bladder as before with small diverticula. Estimated prostate volume 15 cc.  
  
Modest free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis now.  
  
INTERPRETATION  
  
Stable normal renal size. Echogenic renal cortex, slightly more so, in keeping with medical renal disease. Trace perinephric fluid. Modest free intraperitoneal fluid now.  
  
Trabeculated bladder as before.

CT BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST  
  
  
TECHNIQUE: Nonenhanced acquisition with multiplanar reformations.  
  
INDICATION: Reassess bilateral SDH.  
  
COMPARISON: CT October 24, 2025 6:03 PM  
  
FINDINGS:  
Study assessment is limited by motion artifact.  
  
Stable right frontal acute left frontoparietal acute on chronic subdural hematomas with similar mild mass effect. No midline shift.  
Similar trace right frontal subarachnoid, tentorial subdural and right occipital horn intraventricular hemorrhage..  
No acute infarction or new hemorrhage.  
The ventricles and basal cisterns are normal in size and position.  
  
The orbits are unremarkable in appearance.  
Similar mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. Otherwise, the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  
No extracranial soft tissue or acute bone abnormality.  
  
OPINION:  
No significant interval change compared to recent CT.

CHEST PA AND LATERAL  
  
  
HISTORY:ISO, ClinHx:r/o pneumonia. fever and confusion. recent admit with NSTEMI  
  
COMPARISON:September 23, 2025  
  
FINDINGS:  
  
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, unchanged. Previous CABG surgery. Coronary stents in place.  
  
No evidence of pulmonary edema. There are few linear bandlike opacities project over the mid to lower left lung, likely representing subsegmental atelectasis. No consolidative opacities detected to suggest underlying pneumonia/aspiration.  
  
No detectable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
  
No acute osseous abnormality. Intact midline sternotomy wires.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  
  
  
COMPARISON: Most recent CT from January 7, 2025 from outside facility.  
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Acute hyperdense right frontal subdural hematoma measures up to 9 mm in thickness. Left frontoparietal convexity subdural hematoma is slightly larger but mostly lower density, with small area of hyperdensity in keeping with an acute on chronic  
hematoma. This subdural measures 18 mm in thickness. Traces of subdural blood along the tentorium. Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in right frontal convexity sulci. Small focus of subacute chronic subdural hematoma right parietal convexity.  
Trace of intraventricular hemorrhage right occipital horn.  
  
No definite acute ischemic change. No midline shift. No hydrocephalus. Mild atrophic changes. Bilateral chronic appearing lacunar infarcts in the lentiform nuclei and right caudate.  
  
The orbits are unremarkable. Mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells. Mastoid air cells are clear. No lytic bone lesion.  
  
IMPRESSION:  
Bilateral (L>R) acute-on-chronic subdural hematomas, predominantly frontal in distribution, and associated with mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma but no midline shift. Subarachnoid blood in right frontal sulci, and trace of IVH in the right  
occipital horn.
