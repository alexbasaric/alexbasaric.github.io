preparing to ask doctors about paliative care, to focous on reducing suffering. trying to give context to doctors.
my dad was diagnosed with CMML in june 2023, at the time was 
told to have about 2 years to live . He had no problems until dec 2024 when he had a hematoma in his arm told me and my sister for the first time about CMML diagnosis. at that time he thought the disease is progressing to acute stage, and inquired about euthanasia(MAID).
However he recovered from hematoma, but had e more hospital stays in the following 10 months, for hematoma in leg,  something on left eye, chest pain, which resulted in stent placement. Each recovery reduced his abilities a little. given all this, maybe its time to focus on paliarive care.

That’s actually a very clear and thoughtful summary — not too verbose at all. It gives doctors exactly what they need: the timeline, pattern of decline, and your family’s goals. You could, however, make it a bit more concise and structured so it’s easier for them to absorb quickly, especially during a busy hospital discussion.

Here’s a refined version you might use when speaking or writing to the team:

Context for Palliative Care Discussion

My father was diagnosed with CMML in June 2023 and was told at the time that his prognosis might be about two years. He did quite well until December 2024, when he developed a hematoma in his arm. That’s when he told us about his diagnosis for the first time. At that point, he was worried the disease was progressing and even asked about euthanasia (MAID).

He recovered from that episode but has had several hospitalizations since — for a leg hematoma, an eye issue on the left side, and chest pain that led to a stent placement. Each recovery seemed to leave him a little weaker and less independent.

Given this gradual decline, we feel it may be time to focus on palliative care — with the main goal of reducing suffering and maintaining comfort, rather than continuing aggressive interventions.

This version:

Keeps all your important points.

Is emotionally clear without being heavy-handed.

Guides doctors directly toward what you want: a shift in goals of care discussion.


Would you like me to help you turn this into a short note or message you could share directly with the care team (for example, in the patient portal or during rounds)?
Yes

Here’s a version you can copy or read to the care team — short, clear, and compassionate. It works well in a written note (e.g., through a hospital portal or left for the attending physician), or you can use it as talking points in person:

Message for Care Team – Request to Discuss Palliative Care

Hello,

I’d like to share some background about my father to help guide next steps in his care.

He was diagnosed with CMML in June 2023 and was told his expected survival might be about two years. He remained stable until December 2024, when he had a hematoma in his arm and first told us about his diagnosis. He recovered but has since had several hospitalizations — for a leg hematoma, a left eye problem, and chest pain that required a stent. Each episode has left him a bit weaker and less able to recover fully.

Given his gradual decline and overall condition, our family feels it may be time to focus more on comfort and quality of life rather than aggressive treatments. We’d like to discuss options for palliative care, with the main goal of reducing suffering and maintaining dignity and comfort.

Thank you for understanding and helping us plan the best approach for him.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make a spoken version too — something you could say naturally during rounds or a family meeting, in case you prefer to speak rather than hand over a note?


yes

Here’s a spoken version — something you can say naturally during rounds or a family meeting. It’s calm, respectful, and helps steer the discussion toward palliative care without sounding confrontational or emotional under stress:

Spoken version (approx. 40 seconds):

> “I’d like to share a bit of background about my dad to help guide his care.
He was diagnosed with CMML in June 2023 and was told his life expectancy might be around two years. He stayed fairly well until last December, when he had a hematoma in his arm — that’s when he first told us about his diagnosis.
Since then, he’s had several hospital stays — for another hematoma in his leg, a problem with his left eye, and chest pain that led to a stent. Each time, he’s recovered, but a little less fully than before.
Given this gradual decline, our family feels it may be time to focus more on comfort and reducing suffering, rather than continuing aggressive treatments. We’d like to discuss whether palliative care could be appropriate now.”

This version:

Sounds natural and empathetic.

Gives enough medical context for doctors to orient quickly.

Clearly states your goal (“focus on comfort and reducing suffering”).


Would you like me to also help you with a follow-up question list — for example, what specific things to ask the palliative team once they meet you (like pain control, nutrition, or emotional support)?


Yes

Excellent — that’s a wise step. Having a few focused, clear questions ready will help you get the most from the palliative care discussion. Here’s a list you can keep on paper or your phone; you don’t have to ask them all, just the ones that feel most relevant in the moment.

🩺 Key Questions for the Palliative Care or Medical Team

1. Goals and focus of care

Based on his current condition, what is realistic to expect in terms of recovery or improvement?

At this stage, would focusing on comfort and quality of life be the most appropriate goal?

How does palliative care fit with his current treatment plan? Can it be started while he’s still in hospital?


2. Comfort and symptom management

What can be done to reduce his suffering or discomfort — especially pain, shortness of breath, or agitation?

Are there ways to make him more comfortable if he remains unable to eat, speak, or move much?

How can we ensure he’s not in pain or distress, even if he can’t communicate it?


3. Medical interventions

Which treatments are still meaningful at this stage, and which ones might only prolong suffering?

Are there decisions we should make now about resuscitation, ICU transfer, or future hospitalizations?

What happens if an infection or another complication develops — would comfort care at that point be an option?


4. Support for the family

What kind of emotional or practical support can the palliative team provide for the family?

Who should we contact if we have questions or if his condition changes suddenly?

If he’s discharged, what options exist for home or hospice palliative care?


5. Communication and continuity

Will there be a single point of contact (doctor, nurse, or coordinator) who keeps us informed?

How often will the team update us about his comfort and care decisions?



---

💡 Tip:
If you feel emotional during the meeting, you can start with a short statement like:

> “This is hard for us, but our main goal now is to reduce his suffering and keep him comfortable.”



That simple sentence helps re-center the team around your father’s comfort, which is the essence of palliative care.

Would you like me to tailor this list specifically for your father’s current ICU situation — where he’s sleeping, on antibiotics, and not waking up — so it fits that exact context?
