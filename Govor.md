# my first draft

My father was mechanical engineer, interested in all new technoliges at the time. Also had very good sense of humor.

For example, he created a functuional radio receiver, when they were still rarities where he lived, put it in shoe box and wrote Blupunkt over it. Blaupunkt was famous German brand of electornics, as you may know.

He tried to pass on interest in mechanics to me with more or less success. When I was growing up he had a garage with all sorts of tools, mostly for car reparis. Along with routine maintanance like changin oil, brake pads, he would work on complete overhaul of transmission. At one point it left the car in drivable state but whenever you'd use reverse, you'd have to kneel down behind the right front wheel and find and push a knob that would unlock the other gears. That, and the fact that car often needed to be started by being pushed or running downhill, made me very good at finding just right parking spot.

Next, he thought me to drive from earlest age possible. Starting when I was about 5 or six, when traveling to relatives in Becej, we would turn itno countlry road between fields of corn or wheat and he would let me turn the stearing wheel, first from his lap, and as soon as I could reach the pedals, i was driving all by myself!

When I was in my teens, even before I was of legal age, he would let me drive on remote roads, while wearing sunglasses, (to hide my age), and also at night - basically I learned dirving at night.

When I was at age to take driving exam I already was driving pretty well, so he found out that it is possible to take directly "C" test (this is for trucks in Europe). Payning for driving school would be waste, and it turuned out that C was chepar, as it required only 10 dirving lessons on a truck instead 40 in a car.

One of his favourite fables is "Sve, sve ali zanat" (try to find it for background, most serbian peaople know it) - so he wanted me to learn practical trades, including driving. He urged me also to pass for D category (bus in Europe), althouh I never really needed it in my life.

Except that having C lincence helped when I had to serve my mandatory. one year military service - they assigned me a role of truck driver, which is not that bad compared to other possibilities.

Anothere important "influence", I mentioned before that he had very broad interest in technolgo, so when in the early 80-s personal computers started to proliferate, at the very begining, befor IBM PC took over, there was famous Z80 based computer, Sinclari Spectrum. He was the first to get one, and start learning basic, me along side. I got a handle of a book and couple of magaizines and starte learning by typing Basic code from pages of computer book or magazine, and analyzing it, modifiying it (until it is broken of course). At on point we were together writing a simple quiz / game program, he called it "IQ test", and brouht it to a presentable state. Then he encouraged me to call in local radio host, most people will remember, Zoran Modli, who had occaionlly played Spectrum or Comodore games over the airways. Listeners would record it to casette tape, then load it into their computer.  He played our program too, one Saturday morning.

# his comment

This is a wonderful, vivid set of memories — rich with warmth, humor, and personality.  
You’ve already provided the heart of a great _celebration of life_ speech.

Here’s what I suggest we do next:

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Core themes I see

From your notes, I can already see **four natural themes** emerging:

1. **Curiosity and ingenuity** — the homemade radio, the early computers, his love of technology.
    
2. **Hands-on practicality** — his mechanical skills, the garage, fixing cars, and that “reverse gear” story.
    
3. **Fatherly teaching** — passing on driving, mechanics, and a belief in learning real skills (“Sve, sve ali zanat”).
    
4. **Shared humor and connection** — that dry, witty side in the way he approached life.
    

---

## 🧱 Step 2 — How we’ll structure the speech

I’ll help you build a 3–5 minute speech shaped like this:

1. **Opening (30–45 seconds):** introduce him warmly — set the tone, mention his humor and curiosity.
    
2. **Middle (3–4 minutes):** weave through your stories — grouped by theme, flowing naturally.
    
    - The radio story and curiosity about new technology.
        
    - The garage, mechanical know-how, and creative fixes.
        
    - Learning to drive (the sunglasses and country roads).
        
    - Computers, Spectrum, and your “IQ test” program.
        
3. **Closing (30–45 seconds):** reflection — what those things say about who he was, what he passed on, and how you remember him.

## 🗒️ Step 3 — Next action

Let’s now take your stories and **expand each one** into a short paragraph, keeping your voice natural and personal.

You can either:

- ✅ Ask me to create the **first full draft** of the speech from what you wrote (I’ll turn your notes into a touching, flowing narrative),  
    **or**
    
- ✏️ I can help you expand each topic one by one, and then assemble them together afterward.
    

Which way would you prefer to go?

lets start with you creating the first draft

# his first full draft

Here’s a **first full draft** of your speech — about 4 minutes when read aloud calmly. It keeps your warmth, humor, and all the wonderful details you shared.

## 🎤 Celebration of Life Speech – First Draft

When I think of my father, **Dobrosav Basarić – Doca**, I think of curiosity, humor, and a pair of hands that could fix almost anything.  
He was a mechanical engineer — practical, creative, and fascinated by every new technology that appeared in his lifetime. But he wasn’t just skilled; he had a sense of humor that made even his experiments memorable.

One of my favorite stories is from when radios were still rare in his hometown. He built his own receiver from scratch, placed it in a shoebox, and proudly wrote “Blupunkt” across the front — a slightly misspelled version of “Blaupunkt,” the famous German brand. It worked perfectly, and so did the joke. That combination — technical skill and a playful spirit — was very much him.

He tried to pass on his love for mechanics to me, with varying success. When I was growing up, he always had a garage full of tools and car parts. Routine maintenance for him meant things like replacing brake pads or rebuilding an entire transmission. I still remember one “experiment” that left our car drivable — except that to shift out of reverse, you had to kneel down behind the right front wheel and push a little knob by hand. That, along with the fact that the car often needed a downhill start, taught me early on how to find _just the right parking spot._

He also taught me to drive from the youngest age possible. On country roads near Bečej, when I was maybe five or six, he would let me turn the steering wheel from his lap. As soon as I could reach the pedals, I was driving all by myself. Later, in my teens, he’d let me drive remote roads while wearing sunglasses — to make me look older — and even at night, so by the time I was old enough for a license, I was already an experienced driver.

Always practical, he found a shortcut for that too. Instead of sending me to driving school, he realized it was cheaper to go straight for the “C” category license — for trucks. Only ten lessons instead of forty! He even encouraged me to get the “D” category, for buses, just in case.  
He used to say, _“Sve, sve, ali zanat”_ — which roughly means, “Learn everything you can, but always have a trade.” That was one of his favorite sayings. And that belief — that practical knowledge gives you freedom — stayed with me. It even came in handy during my year of mandatory military service, when I ended up as a truck driver, thanks to him.

He also had a deep curiosity about new technologies. In the early 1980s, when home computers were just appearing, before the IBM PC became common, he bought a Sinclair Spectrum — one of the first of its kind. We learned BASIC programming together, side by side, typing code from computer magazines, breaking it, fixing it, and learning by doing. Together we even wrote a small quiz game — he called it _“IQ Test”_ — and one day he encouraged me to call the famous radio host Zoran Modli, who played computer programs over the airwaves.  
He actually played ours, one Saturday morning. I’ll never forget the pride in my dad’s eyes that day.

All these stories — the garage, the car repairs, the radio in the shoebox, the late-night driving lessons, the home computer experiments — they all show who he was.  
Curious, resourceful, and quietly funny.  
He believed in figuring things out, in staying young by learning something new, and in sharing that excitement with others.

That’s how I’ll remember him — and how I hope to keep a part of him alive: by staying curious, by finding humor in challenges, and by passing along what he taught me, one story at a time.

Would you like me to make a **shorter version** (around 2½ minutes, more conversational) or polish this one for **delivery rhythm** — pacing, pauses, and transitions for reading aloud at the service?
